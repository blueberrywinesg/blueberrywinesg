                            <p style="text-align: justify;">BC wines are famous around the world, thanks to our pristine, abundant vineyards. Taking a wine tour through the mild atmosphere of southwestern region of British Columbia is one of the top items on any visitor’s “to-do” list. But Canadians wines are not just about grapes anymore: irrigation techniques bringing crystal-clear artesian water from the coastal mountains to the Richmond delta have allowed British Columbia farmers to grow the most delicious blueberries anyone will ever find, and we knew that making the perfect wine from this perfect fruit would need the help of Sanduz Estate Wines, the BC masters of blueberry cultivation and fruit wines. Distinctive by their gorgeous tint, their incomparable flavour, and—as a bonus—their multiple health benefits, our wines are steadily making British Columbia famous in a completely different way.</p>
